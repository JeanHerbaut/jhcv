1. Overall Aesthetic

    Style: Modern, clean, slightly minimalist but with a few accent colors or shapes to add personality.

    Layout: A full-width section-based design where each “section” (Intro, About, Experience, Data, Contact) spans nearly the viewport height, with smooth scrolling or anchor links in the nav.

    Color Palette:

        Background: Near-white or a soft neutral (e.g., #FAFAFA) as a base.

        Primary Accent: A muted teal (#00A8A8) or vibrant but not neon color for headings and highlight elements.

        Secondary Accent: A friendly golden or pastel coral (#F08A5D, #FBD148, etc.) for subtle highlights or buttons.

        Dark Text: Standard black (#000) or a very dark gray (#333) for primary text.

    Typography:

        Headers: A modern sans-serif with strong weight (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins).

        Body: A complementary sans-serif or clean serif (like Open Sans or Lora) for easy reading.

    Section Dividers: Use subtle backgrounds or geometric shapes (a wave, diagonal slash) to differentiate sections.

2. Header & Intro Section

    Top Navigation Bar

        A small, fixed (top) bar with your name or logo on the left and anchor links on the right (e.g., About, Experience, Data, Contact).

        Transparent or slightly opaque background so it’s not overpowering.

    Hero / Intro

        Full-screen or large hero banner with your name and title (e.g., “Digital Project Manager & Business Analyst”).

        A short tagline describing your strengths or approach (“Bridging business and tech with data-driven strategies”).

        If you want a minimal illustration or abstract shape in the background, go for something that matches your color palette.

Example visual cues for DALL·E prompt:

    “A clean, modern one-page website hero section with soft neutral background, large bold text for the name, minimal geometric shapes in teal and coral, and a subtle sense of depth or layering.”

3. About & Experience Sections
About

    Layout: A two-column approach:

        Left column: A short personal bio (like 2–3 paragraphs).

        Right column: Possibly a vertical timeline or a short list of key facts (skills, languages).

    Imagery:

        A friendly portrait or silhouette icon if you want.

        Simple shapes or lines continuing the design language.

Experience

    Consider a horizontal timeline or a set of cards (boxes) for each job role:

        Each card has the job title, company, dates, and bullet points about achievements.

        Maintain consistent styling with subtle shadows or borders around each card.

    Keep the color palette consistent: job title in teal, subheadings in your secondary accent, text in dark gray.

4. Data Insights Section

This is where you highlight stats from your timesheet data (pointage). For a one-page design, you can keep it fairly compact yet visually striking.

    Title: “My Work & Commute Stats”

    Short Explanation: “I track my hours, commutes, and telework vs. on-site to stay productive and healthy. Here’s a quick overview of 2025 so far.”

    Charts (use 2–3 small, colorful charts with a consistent style):

        Pie chart for On-site vs. Telework.

        Pie chart for Train (t) vs. Bike (v) vs. other commute methods.

        Bar/Line chart for Hours Worked vs. Hours Expected (cumulative or monthly).

    Styling:

        Keep the charts on a neutral background.

        Use the same accent colors for each slice (e.g., teal for on-site, coral for telework, gold for train, etc.).

        A minimal legend below or on the side to keep things uncluttered.

5. Contact Section

    Simple: A short sign-off: “Ready to connect? Drop me a line.”

    Contact details:

        Email link, LinkedIn link, etc.

    Optional: A small contact form if you want messages directly from the site (using a service or a basic backend).

Visual cues for DALL·E prompt, for example:

    “A modern minimal contact form section with background shapes in teal and coral, minimal icons for email and LinkedIn, and a clean, open layout.”

6. Icons & Imagery

    Icons:

        Use a free icon library like Heroicons, Feather Icons, or Font Awesome for small accent icons (e.g., LinkedIn, email, location).

    Images:

        Subtle, single-color or duotone images can maintain a minimal aesthetic.

        Avoid large stock photos that clutter the design.

    Graphical shapes:

        Soft or geometric shapes can appear in corners or behind content blocks to add interest without distracting from text.

7. Final Notes for the Mockup

    Consistent Spacing: Use a grid or consistent padding/margin system so the page feels balanced.

    Focus on Readability: Clear heading hierarchy (H1 for name, H2 for section titles, H3 or paragraph text for details).

    Subtle Animations: If you want a modern feel, add small fade-ins or slide-ins for text sections or charts (tastefully, not overdone).
